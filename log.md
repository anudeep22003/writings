Today
- Day 2 implementing routing using react-router. Taking a lot longer than I thought to build a mental model, but learning of many advanced features. I learned how forms are used as the fundamental mutation paradigm for routing, especially in react-router. Loaders, actions and invalidations are fundamental to understand to build a complex app. Next up is building search and all the ocmplexities that come with it. I struggled quite a bit with translating the JS code to TS. Can't shake the feeling that I get it, but implementing for Sidebrain is still going to be a doozy.

Tomorrow
- Finish the tutorial, and start implementing a conversational id based routing in Sidebrain. Also research how you are going to be implementing authentication.
