Today
- Day 2 implementing routing using react-router. Taking a lot longer than I thought to build a mental model, but learning of many advanced features. I learned how forms are used as the fundamental mutation paradigm for routing, especially in react-router. Loaders, actions and invalidations are fundamental to understand to build a complex app. Next up is building search and all the ocmplexities that come with it. I struggled quite a bit with translating the JS code to TS. Can't shake the feeling that I get it, but implementing for Sidebrain is still going to be a doozy.

Tomorrow
- Finish the tutorial, and start implementing a conversational id based routing in Sidebrain. Also research how you are going to be implementing authentication.

Today
- Finished the react-router tutorial. Improved my mental model of how routing works, how to accomplish some complex routing strategies. That said, I can't help but feel like my learning is like that word that is perfect for the point you are trying to make, and you swear you know it but cannot remember it. My mental model for this is at the tip of my mind. I think writing about the various hooks in my own language will help deepen my understanding. 
- Built out a basic UI for the login screens. I find myself getting overwhelmed by the complexity of implementing auth. I need to understand every aspect before starting to code. Rather it is important to start building, and figure out the complexity in v1.1, the first iteration. 

Tomorrow:
- Write out your understanding of the react-router hooks
- Implement a working login experience using Google Login

Today
- Was overwhelmed by authentication. I got a basic version up that acts as a gate but i am not satisfied with it. I got confused by the client and server part and thought that I had to do part of the things in react and part on the python backend. That led me down a rabbit hole to understand about JWT tokens, how auth works (a developing mystery) and how server side components and next work. I now have a better understanding of what NExt does, and think its cool that they specialize in rendering server side components. I think Next is react + SSR, made easy. 
- On the topic of auth itself, I think I will have to write a express server on the frontend to handle the server side of things. Apparently its called Backed for Frontend (BFF) pattern. I still don't know if thats the most efficient thing to do, or the right way to do implement things. 
- Concerned that tomorrow is launch day and I still havent implemented auth much.

Tomorrow
- Implement an express server. Take a decision in the first 30 minutes and stick with it, dont get sidetracked. Implement it and then wonder whether that was the best approach. You need to be writing a lot more code and doing a lot less thinking. 
- Dont worry about getting back on the apps, it isnt an experience you can control. Accept it, treat it as an experiment and incorporate into the next experiment.
