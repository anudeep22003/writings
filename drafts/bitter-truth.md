Madness, and the bitter truth

Central Point:
- an abundance of rules leads to madness
- The truth of neural networks, applies to humans?

Richard Sutton is a legend in the world of computer science, specifically a once esoteric branch called Artificial Intelligence. He is particularly renowned for his work on Reenforcement Learning (RL). RL is the closest algorithm we have for machines to learn the way humans do. In RL, a neural net is trained to maximize a reward. The reward itself is a neural net, that is trained by humans, or by a set of rules in a game. In a simplistic scneario, in a game of chess the next move is chosen to maximize the reward that is obtained by winning the game. 

Rich Sutton, many years ago, wrote an prescient essay titled "The Bitter Truth." In that he posits that the neural nets can be trained either by humans teaching the heuristics of a game, or by feeding vast amounts of data such that the model by itself starts figuring things out for itself. In the first approach, a human in the game of chess, for example, would program into a neural net the bias that certain positions are better suited to success. While this could very well be true, the model did not arrive at this inference by itself. This layer of abstraction becomes a first principle for it, like an atom from which molecules, compounds and organisms of understanding arise. This leads to brittleness in the learning, which is what Rich Sutton explains. 

In his view, the systems that learn the best are ones where you keep the constraints relaxed and evolve the learning by throwing compute and data at the problem. At vast enough quantities of data, the degrees of freedom available to the model start self selecting to arrive at the symbolic pathways that are most succesful at adapting to general problems. 

In a parallel domain, lets talk about rule following in humans. Humans are are controled not by anything physical, but mental constraints. That we should not kill another human is not required per se, but is near universally agreed upon as a moral standard to uphold. To follow the traffic laws, to not steal are similar. Youc an make a case for these rules being fundamental, meaning they are beyond proof. Mathematics is similar that the fundamental rules of math are improvable, but we know they have to be right. If not, almost all modern engineering, science and progress would break down. However we are also surrounded by self-help books telling us how to form habits, how to negotiate, how to accumulate power, how to flirt and how to be creative to name a tiny fraction of the books and content in circulation. The content of these books is akin to a human telling a neural network the roles but we know that external rule optimizing machines are brittle, and not very succesful.
