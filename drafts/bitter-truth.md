Richard Sutton is a legend in the world of computer science, specifically a once esoteric branch called Artificial Intelligence. He is particularly renowned for his work on Reenforcement Learning (RL). RL is the closest algorithm we have for machines to learn the way humans do. In RL, a neural net is trained to maximize a reward. The reward itself is a neural net, that is trained by humans, or by a set of rules in a game. In a simplistic scneario, in a game of chess the next move is chosen to maximize the reward that is obtained by winning the game. 

Rich Sutton, many years ago, wrote an prescient essay titled "The Bitter Truth." In that he posits that the neural nets can be trained either by humans teaching the heuristics of a game, or by feeding vast amounts of data such that the model by itself starts figuring things out for itself. In the first approach, a human in the game of chess, for example, would program into a neural net the bias that certain positions are better suited to success. While this could very well be true, the model did not arrive at this inference by itself. This layer of abstraction becomes a first principle for it, like an atom from which molecules, compounds and organisms of understanding arise. This leads to brittleness in the learning, which is what Rich Sutton explains. 

In his view, the systems that learn the best are ones where you keep the constraints relaxed and evolve the learning by throwing compute and data at the problem. At vast enough quantities of data, the degrees of freedom available to the model start self selecting to arrive at the neural pathways that are most succesful at adapting to general problems.
